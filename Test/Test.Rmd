## Introduction

This is a very minimal example! The only thing which is changed in this template is a few of the default settings in the YAML. 

## Customisation

A simple template like this might be useful to include if you have a common structure of report that you want to run. For example, you change the author name your name. You can edit the sections to include a generic layout.

## Another title for this test

With a different text.

```{r}
2 + 2 + 2
```

```{r}
# just once for every repo ("git init")
usethis::use_git()
```
```{r}
# just once for every work with GitHub
usethis::create_github_token()
```

```{r}
# just once for every repo?
credentials::set_github_pat()
```


```{r}
# create repo manually, then: "git remote add origin <URL>"
usethis::use_github()
```
