## Introduction

This is a very minimal example! The only thing which is changed in this
template is a few of the default settings in the YAML.

## Customisation

A simple template like this might be useful to include if you have a
common structure of report that you want to run. For example, you change
the author name your name. You can edit the sections to include a
generic layout.

## Another title for this test

With a different text.

``` r
2 + 2 + 2
```

    ## [1] 6
